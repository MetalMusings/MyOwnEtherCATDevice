# Making my own EtherCAT device

This repository contains software, pcb shematics and layouts, reference documentation etc
that I used during the creation of my own EtherCAT device.

This job is documented in a series of Youtube videos, from my first attempts to understand
how EtherCAT works, to making my own pcb, program it and testing it in LinuxCNC.

## My own EtherCat device 4. The PCB and details

In this video it starts to be interesting. I have got the pcb and I try to make it work.
Now I finally make documentation available, see [this folder](Pcb-1-lan9252).

## Make my own EtherCAT device 3. Encoder

I made a rudimentary EtherCAT encoder module. To test it I need something better than my test setup so I start to design my own PCB to be used for testing with LinuxCNC.

## Make my own EtherCAT device. 2. MCU and SPI

Testing the SPI connection between the MCU and the LAN9252 chip. Get into state diagrams for EtherCAT and for CIA402.

## Make my own EtherCAT device. 1 Digital IO

My first tries with the LAN9252 chip. Getting accustomed to some tools.
